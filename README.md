# Apprenticeship learning using Inverse Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction 
Reinforcement learning (RL) is is the very basic and most intuitive form of trial and error learning. Often referred to as learning by exploration, that is by taking random actions initially and then slowly figuring out the actions which lead to the desired motion. In any RL setting, to make the agent perform different behaviors, it is the reward structure that one must modify/exploit. But assume we only have the knowledge of the behavior of the expert with us, then how do we estimate the reward structure given a particular behavior in the environment? This is the problem of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), where given the optimal/sub-optimal expert policy, we wish to determine the underlying reward structure.
